# coding101

Coding101 is a guide for people who are interested in learning to code, but are not familiar with coding tools enough to be confident of making a choice about where to start.

This guide will

- Curate all the best resources for getting into code
- Ask a couple of questions to figure out what part of tech (front-end, back-end, ML, etc) the person might find most interesting
- Create a track for this person based on this profiling that might be the most engaging way for them to get into coding

### Who is coding101 for?

coding101 is for you if you are interested in learning to code, but don't know where to start.

### Who is coding101 NOT for?

coding101 is NOT for you if you already know-it-all.

## How can I contribute?

Many developers go down the road to learning development alone. 

You could share your learning experience to make this easier for others taking this road.

You could fork this repo, make our code better and make a pull request. We'd be grateful.

You could make life easier for a coding newbie by providing help when they are stuck.
